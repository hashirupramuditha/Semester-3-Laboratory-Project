# Hot-Plate-Temperature-Controller-Using-PID

PID controller, which consists of proportional, integral and differential parts is widely used in controlling systems. PID systems in general work as a control feedback loop mechanism. In these systems, error; the difference between required output and the current output is calculated continuously and adjusted using proportional, integral and differential parts until the desired, stable output level is reached. In this project we designed a analog circuit system to control the temperature of a hot plate using the PID controlling mechanism.

The whole system can be broken down into main 4 parts as follows.
  1. Power Supply Unit
  2. Sensor Interfacing Unit
  3. PID Controlling Unit
  4. Firing Angle Controlling Unit

The main functional blockdiagram view of the system is given below.

This repository is included the docmentation files, schematic files, PCB designing and enclosure designing files of the complete project.
