# Hot-Plate-Temperature-Controller-Using-PID

PID controller, which consists of proportional, integral and differential parts is widely used in controlling systems. PID systems in general work as a control feedback loop mechanism. In these systems, error; the difference between required output and the current output is calculated continuously and adjusted using proportional, integral and differential parts until the desired, stable output level is reached. In this project we designed an analog circuit system to control the temperature of a hot plate using the PID controlling mechanism.

The whole system can be broken down into 4 main units as follows.
  1. Power Supply Unit
  2. Sensor Interfacing Unit
  3. PID Controlling Unit
  4. Firing Angle Controlling Unit

The main functional blockdiagram view of the system is given below.

The maximum controlling temeperature of this system is about 200<sup>o</sup>C and the complete design is designed using analog circuit systems. Based on theoretical calculations, values for analog circuit components were selected and the system was simulated based on those component values by using Multisim simulation software tool.

This repository is included the simulation files, schematic, layout and 3D files, PCB designing and enclosure designing files of the complete project.
